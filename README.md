Use [WebClient](https://telecommand.netlify.app/) from Students End

Use Android App to connect with Arduino Controller (Laboratory End)

# Features

- Pre-recorded lab instructions with __mutiple cameraview.__
- Students can get real __practice experience__ by controling aparatus, collecting lab data and conducting experiment
- __Low latency__ command sending with realtime database.
- Low latency video stream with WebRTC(Currently used google meet as there was not enought time to implement it).
- All lab class all in one place.


# Development



# Used Technologies

-  __Firebase realtime database:__ for sending command from web client(student) to arduino device(lab).
- __Firebase firestore:__ to store class links
- __Google Auth:__ for student authorization.
- __React__: for web app(student end).
- __Android__: for controlling arduino device.
- __Arduino__: for performing lab activities remotely(from home).
